        <h3>FIRST MEET</h3>
        <p>I met her for the first time at school. she was lost in colors, painting the streets, and I was just there, quietly cheering her on. We wandered together under the afternoon sky, sharing laughs and moments that felt like little sparks. Then, we picked out matching tiny mushroom keychains, something small, but it made my heart smile. I didn’t expect to see her again, but fate had other plans when her friend asked me to join them for billiards that Saturday. And just like that, a simple day turned into the start of something beautiful.</p>

      <h2>#02 APRIL 3</h2>
      <h3>DRAWING</h3>
      <p>April 3 felt like something special. I asked her if she wanted to eat after school, and she said yes. We weren’t alone, her friends were with us, but even with the crowd, she still made it feel like it was just the two of us. We shared a simple meal and some laughs, and even exchanged gifts like it was second nature.

She gave me a drawing of myself, one she made with so much detail and care, and a phone charm that I now carry everywhere. It wasn’t just a gift, it was a piece of her, something real and personal.

Time went by faster than I wanted it to. But honestly, just being near her, talking, laughing, even with her friends around, made the whole day feel right. There was this quiet comfort in her presence, and I realized that even the smallest moments with her feel unforgettable..</p>

      <h3>PHOTOBOOTH</h3>
      <p>I asked her if she wanted to hang out again, and she said yes. We didn’t have anything big planned, just wanted to spend time together. At some point, I asked if she wanted to try a photobooth with me, and she agreed.

We honestly didn’t even know how to pose. We were just there, smiling, laughing, figuring it out as we went. But it didn’t matter. Being beside her, capturing those silly, genuine moments, felt like one of the best things ever.

It wasn’t about perfect photos. It was about sharing that time with her, enjoying each other's presence, and making memories I know I’ll always hold onto.</p>

      <h2>#04 APRIL 12</h2>
      <h3>CONFESSION</h3>
      <p>April 12 is a date I’ll always hold close to my heart. That was the day everything became real between us. finally admitted what we had both been feeling. We told each other that we liked one another, that we wanted to understand each other more, to grow together and see where this could go. It was simple, but it meant everything.

In that moment, something changed in me. I wasn’t just happy or excited. I felt this deep sense of peace, like my heart had been waiting for her all along. That day, I made a silent promise to myself. I promised that no matter what, I would do everything I can to be the best for her. I would love her right, treat her with all the care she deserves, and never let her question her worth.

I want to be the one she can count on when things get heavy. I want to be there to make her smile on the good days and hold her through the bad ones. And more than anything, I want to build a future with her. Not just a relationship, but a life. The kind where we grow old together, still laughing, still holding hands, still choosing each other every single day.

I know we’re still just getting to know each other, but I already see the kind of love I want to give, and it’s hers. She is the one I want to walk this life with. And from April 12 onward, I’ve held onto that promise with my whole heart.</p>

      <h2>#05 APRIL 21</h2>
      <h3>FIRST TIME</h3>
      <p>April 21 was the first time we saw each other again after the day we confessed. There was this soft excitement in the air, like we both knew something special was unfolding. We decided to go on a little date at a local cat café called Hello Meow. It was cozy, warm, and filled with cute cats roaming around, but all I could really focus on was her.

That day was full of firsts. It was the first time we held each other’s hand. At first, it felt a little awkward, like we were both unsure of how to make that move. But when our hands finally met, it just felt right. Like two missing pieces gently locking into place. We didn’t have to say much just being there, together, said it all.

We talked, laughed, watched the cats play, and shared quiet moments that didn’t feel empty at all. Everything felt soft and simple, like time slowed down just for us. We truly enjoyed each other’s company that day, and even though it was just the beginning, it felt like something real was already growing between us.</p>

      <h3>A NIGHT TO REMEMBER</h3>
      <p>She invited me to celebrate the fiesta at their place. We met at Waltermart, and on the bus ride to her home, we held hands for a long time. We whispered how much we loved each other, and in that moment, it felt like the world had slowed down just for us. I didn’t want to let go.

At her place, we ate, laughed, and spent time together. I met her family for the first time, and I felt truly happy to be part of her day. But when the night came and I had to leave, that’s when it hurt the most.

She held my hand secretly as we said goodbye, like she didn’t want me to go. I wanted to hug her, to stay just a little longer, but I couldn’t. Still, her touch stayed with me, and so did the feeling of being loved.

      <h3>HUGS & KISSES</h3>
      <p>We went to a photobooth again, but this time as two people who truly liked each other. Everything felt different, warmer, deeper. We laughed, posed, and made memories in snapshots that I’ll always treasure.

That day, we hugged for a long time. It wasn’t just a hug, it was something I felt in my soul. Then she kissed me on the cheek, and I froze not out of shock, but because in that moment, I felt the kind of love I had always dreamed of.

I didn’t know how to react, only that I was thankful. Thankful that she let me love her. Thankful that she loved me too. And deep in my heart, I knew I wanted more days like that. More moments with her. More of us.</p>

      <h2>#08 MAY 03</h2>
      <h3>I MISS YOU</h3>
      <p>After that beautiful day at the photobooth, we already missed each other. So we met again the very next day, just to be near, just to feel that calm happiness again. We sat together at Dunkin Donuts, no need for anything grand just us, a quiet table, and the comfort of each other’s presence.

We held hands the whole time. Not out of habit, but out of need. That kind of touch that doesn’t just warm your skin, but reaches your heart. A soft reminder that you are seen, cared for, and deeply loved. It was a quiet kind of intimacy, the kind that says everything without a single word.

In her touch, I felt peace. In her smile, I felt home. And in that moment, I realized even more how much I cherish her. I didn’t want to let go. I just wanted more days like that simple, soft, and full of love.</p>
