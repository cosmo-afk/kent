        <h2>#01 MARCH 25</h2>
        <h3>First Meet</h3>
        <p>I met her for the first time at school. she was lost in colors, painting the streets, and I was just there, quietly cheering her on. We wandered together under the afternoon sky, sharing laughs and moments that felt like little sparks. Then, we picked out matching tiny mushroom keychains, something small, but it made my heart smile. I didn’t expect to see her again, but fate had other plans when her friend asked me to join them for billiards that Saturday. And just like that, a simple day turned into the start of something beautiful.</p>

      <h2>#02 APRIL 3</h2>
      <h3>DRAWING</h3>
      <p>April 3 felt like something special. I asked her if she wanted to eat after school, and she said yes. We weren’t alone, her friends were with us, but even with the crowd, she still made it feel like it was just the two of us. We shared a simple meal and some laughs, and even exchanged gifts like it was second nature.

She gave me a drawing of myself, one she made with so much detail and care, and a phone charm that I now carry everywhere. It wasn’t just a gift, it was a piece of her, something real and personal.

Time went by faster than I wanted it to. But honestly, just being near her, talking, laughing, even with her friends around, made the whole day feel right. There was this quiet comfort in her presence, and I realized that even the smallest moments with her feel unforgettable..</p>

      <h2>#03 APRIL 10</h2>
      <h3>PHOTOBOOTH</h3>
      <p>I asked her if she wanted to hang out again, and she said yes. We didn’t have anything big planned, just wanted to spend time together. At some point, I asked if she wanted to try a photobooth with me, and she agreed.

We honestly didn’t even know how to pose. We were just there, smiling, laughing, figuring it out as we went. But it didn’t matter. Being beside her, capturing those silly, genuine moments, felt like one of the best things ever.

It wasn’t about perfect photos. It was about sharing that time with her, enjoying each other's presence, and making memories I know I’ll always hold onto.</p>

      <h2>#04 APRIL 12</h2>
      <h3>CONFESSION</h3>
      <p>April 12 is a date I’ll always hold close to my heart. That was the day everything became real between us. finally admitted what we had both been feeling. We told each other that we liked one another, that we wanted to understand each other more, to grow together and see where this could go. It was simple, but it meant everything.

In that moment, something changed in me. I wasn’t just happy or excited. I felt this deep sense of peace, like my heart had been waiting for her all along. That day, I made a silent promise to myself. I promised that no matter what, I would do everything I can to be the best for her. I would love her right, treat her with all the care she deserves, and never let her question her worth.

I want to be the one she can count on when things get heavy. I want to be there to make her smile on the good days and hold her through the bad ones. And more than anything, I want to build a future with her. Not just a relationship, but a life. The kind where we grow old together, still laughing, still holding hands, still choosing each other every single day.

I know we’re still just getting to know each other, but I already see the kind of love I want to give, and it’s hers. She is the one I want to walk this life with. And from April 12 onward, I’ve held onto that promise with my whole heart.</p>
